### Introduction
The source-record-manager(SRM) converts MARC records to Inventory instances while handling incoming data. The process of converting MARC record into Instance object is usually called **MARC-to-Instance mapping**. 

Conversion logic is defined by mapping rules and these rules are described in JSON. Mapping rule basically has functions for data normalization(trim leading whitespaces, remove slashes, remove ending punctuation) and the target Instance field, where to put result of mapping.
#### *This document describes structure of rules, flags, real use cases and REST API to work with.*
#
### What is mapping rule
Basically, rule is a simple key-value JSON element. The key serves a MARC record's field(tag). The value itself is a rule.
```json
Rule:
{
  "001":[
    {
      "target":"hrid",
      "description":"The human readable ID"
    }
  ]
}
```
This rule belongs to the "001" field and handles all the "001" fields from incoming record. It takes value from "001" field and puts it into Instance "hrid" field. Such rules are usual for **Control field**.
#### Normalization functions
In most cases the record value needs to be normalized before getting into Instance field, because of record data is often raw and mixed . For this purpose we have to use such structure:
 ```json
MARC Record: "001": "393/89/3"
```
```json
Rule:
  "001":[
    {
      "target":"hrid",
      "description":"The human readable ID",
      "rules":[
        {
          "conditions":[
            {
              "type":"remove_substring",
              "parameter":{
                "substring":"/"
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
```
`remove_substring` is normalization function, that removes given substring from field's value. The function just doing a job and returns string that gets into Instance "hrid" field.
An outcome Instance looks like this in Json:
```json
Instance: 
{
  "hrid": "393893"
}
```

[Here](https://github.com/folio-org/mod-source-record-manager/blob/master/mod-source-record-manager-server/src/main/java/org/folio/services/mappers/processor/functions/NormalizationFunction.java) all the formatting functions defined. Most useful are: `trim, capitalize, remove_ending_punc`.

 In most cases there are sub-fields present in field, that is important for mapping. Example for "250" field with `a, b, 6` sub-fields comes below: 
 ```json
MARC Record: "250":{"ind1":"", "ind2":"", "subfields":[ { "a":" fifth ed." }, { "b":"Editor in chief Lord Mackay of Clashfern. " } , {"6":"880-02"}]}
```
```json
Rule:
  "250":[
    {
      "target":"edition",
      "description":"Edition",
      "subfield":["a", "b"],
      "rules":[
        {
          "conditions":[
            {
              "type":"capitalize, trim"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
```
This rule takes only "a" and "b" sub-fields and calls normalization functions for each sub-field. The result is concatenated in one string and written to the Instance "edition" field. An outcome Instance looks like this in Json:
```json
Instance:
{
  "edition": "Fifth ed. Editor in chief Lord Mackay of Clashfern."
}
```
#### Mapping for complex fields
What if the target Instance field is not simple String, but List of complex objects with several fields in ? This happends usually if record field is a **Data field**. We can write rule to map record as below: 
 ```json
MARC Record: "264":{"subfields":[{"a":"Chicago, Illinois :"}, {"b":"The HistoryMakers,"}, {"c":"[2016]"}], "ind1":" ", "ind2":"1"}
```
```json
Rule:
"264": [
    {
      "target": "publication.place",
      "description": "Place of publication",
      "subfield": ["a"],
      "rules": []
    },
    {
      "target": "publication.publisher",
      "description": "Publisher of publication",
      "subfield": ["b"],
      "rules": []
    },
    {
      "target": "publication.dateOfPublication",
      "description": "Date of publication",
      "subfield": ["c"],
      "rules": []
    }
]
```
An outcome Instance looks like this in Json:
```json
Instance:
{
  "publication":[
    {
      "place":"Chicago, Illinois :",
      "publisher":"The HistoryMakers,",
      "dateOfPublication":"[2016]"
    }
  ]
}
```
If there are repeated "264" fields in a single record, then Instance gets several elements in the "publication" field.
To skip mapping for repeated fields and take only first occurrence We can use `ignoreSubsequentFields` flag:
 ```json
MARC Record:
"336":{"subfields":[{"a":"text"}, {"b":"txt"}, {"2":"rdacontent"}], "ind1":" ", "ind2":" "},  ...
"336":{"subfields":[{"a":"performed music"}, {"b":"prm"}, {"2":"rdacontent"}], "ind1":" ", "ind2":" "}
```
```json
Rule:
"336": [
    {
      "target": "instanceTypeId",
      "description": "Instance type ID",
      "ignoreSubsequentFields": true,
      "subfield": ["b"],
      "rules": []
    }
  ]
```
An outcome Instance looks like this in Json:
```json
Instance:
{
  "instanceTypeId": "txt"
}
```

#### Multiple objects from one field
Usually, the [Rule Processor](https://github.com/folio-org/mod-source-record-manager/blob/master/mod-source-record-manager-server/src/main/java/org/folio/services/mappers/processor/Processor.java) creates only one instance of the 'target' field for each record field. What if We need to create several objects from single record field ?
##### New object for group of sub-fields
In example below we map several 'publication' elements from a single "264" record field. To do so, we have to wrap mapping structure into `entity`:
 ```json
MARC Record:
  "264": {
    "subfields":[
         {"a":"Chicago, Illinois :"}, 
         {"b":"The HistoryMakers,"}, 
         {"c":"[2016]"}, 
         {"f":"Nashville, Tennessee"}, 
         {"g":"Revenant Records"}, 
         {"h":"[2015]"}
    ], 
    "ind1":" ", 
    "ind2":"1"
    }
```
```json
Rule:
  "264": [
    {
      "entity": [
        {
          "target": "publication.place",
          "description": "Place of publication",
          "subfield": ["a"],
          "rules": []
        },
        {
          "target": "publication.publisher",
          "description": "Publisher of publication",
          "subfield": ["b"],
          "rules": []
        },
        {
          "target": "publication.dateOfPublication",
          "description": "Date of publication",
          "subfield": ["c"],
          "rules": []
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "entity": [
        {
          "target": "publication.place",
          "description": "Place of publication",
          "subfield": ["f"],
          "rules": []
        },
        {
          "target": "publication.publisher",
          "description": "Publisher of publication",
          "subfield": ["g"],
          "rules": []
        },
        {
          "target": "publication.dateOfPublication",
          "description": "Date of publication",
          "subfield": ["h"],
          "rules": []
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
```
An outcome Instance looks like this in Json:
```json
Instance:
{
  "publication":[
    {
      "place":"Chicago, Illinois :",
      "publisher":"The HistoryMakers,",
      "dateOfPublication":"[2016]"
    },
    {
      "place":"Nashville, Tennessee :",
      "publisher":"Revenant Records,",
      "dateOfPublication":"[2015]"
    }
  ]
}
```
##### New object per repeated sub-fields
If there are several repeated sub-fields in one single record, then `entity` will concatenate them. To create a new object per each sub-field even if they are repeated, we can use `entityPerRepeatedSubfield` flag:
 ```json
MARC Record:
  "264": {
    "subfields":[
         {"a":"Chicago, Illinois :"},
         {"a":"Nashville, Tennessee"},
         {"f": "Austin Texas"}
    ], 
    "ind1":" ", 
    "ind2":"1"
    }
```
```json
Rule:
  "264": [
    {
      "entityPerRepeatedSubfield": true,
      "entity": [
        {
          "target": "publication.place",
          "description": "Place of publication",
          "subfield": ["a", "f"],
          "rules": []
        },
        {
          "target": "publication.publisher",
          "description": "Publisher of publication",
          "subfield": ["a", "f"],
          "rules": [
            {
              "conditions": [],
              "value": "STUB publisher"
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "target": "publication.dateOfPublication",
          "description": "Date of publication",
          "subfield": ["a", "f"],
          "rules": [
            {
              "conditions": [],
              "value": "STUB date"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
```
An outcome Instance looks like this in Json:
```json
Instance:
{
  "publication":[
    {
      "place":"Chicago, Illinois :",
      "publisher":"STUB publisher,",
      "dateOfPublication":"STUB date"
    },
    {
      "place":"Nashville, Tennessee :",
      "publisher":"STUB publisher",
      "dateOfPublication":"STUB date"
    },
    {
      "place":"Austin Texas",
      "publisher":"STUB publisher",
      "dateOfPublication":"STUB date"
    }
  ]
}
```
#### Processing rules on concatenated data
By default rules run on the data in a single sub-field. In order to concatenate un-normalized data, and run the rules on the concatenated data add the following field: `applyRulesOnConcatedData: true`. This can be used when punctuation should only be removed from the end of a concatenated string.
```json
Rule:
"500": [
    {
      "subfield": ["a"],
      "applyRulesOnConcatenatedData": true
    }
]
```
#### Delimiting sub-fields
Grouping sub-fields `"subfield": [ "a", "f"]` will concatenate (space delimited) the values in those sub-fields and place the result in the target. However, if there is a need to declare different delimiters per set of sub-fields, the following can be declared using the `subFieldDelimiter` array:
```json
MARC Record:
  "264": {
    "subfields":[
         {"a":"Chicago, Illinois"},
         {"a":"Nashville, Tennessee"},
         {"f": "Austin Texas"}
    ], 
    "ind1":" ", 
    "ind2":"1"
    }
```
```json
Rule: 
  "265": [
    {
      "target": "publication.place",
      "subfield": ["a","f"],
      "description": "Place of publication",
      "subFieldDelimiter": [
        {
          "value": " & ",
          "subfields": ["a","f"]
        }
      ],
      "rules": []
    }
  ]
```
An outcome Instance looks like this in Json:
```json
Instance: 
{
  "publication":[
    {
      "place":"Chicago, Illinois & Nashville, Tennessee & Austin Texas"
    }
  ]
}
```
#### Required sub-fields
Sometimes there is a need to map target field depending on existence of some sub-field. We use `requiredSubfield`  to define sub-field required to map target field:
```json
MARC Record:
{
  "020":{
    "subfields":[
      {
        "z":"9780190494889"
      },
      {
        "q":"hardcover ;"
      },
      {
        "c":"alkaline paper"
      }
    ],
    "ind1":" ",
    "ind2":" "
  }
}
```
```json
Rule:
"020": [
    {
      "entity": [
        {
          "target": "identifiers.value",
          "description": "Invalid ISBN",
          "subfield": ["z","q","c"],
          "requiredSubfield": ["z"],
          "rules": []
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
```
"z" sub-field is required for mapping "identifiers.value". 
- If no "z" in record sub-fields, then "identifiers.value" remains empty(null).
- If "z" exists among record sub-fields, then "identifiers.value" gets filled by all the `["z","q","c"].`
